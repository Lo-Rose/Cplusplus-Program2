# Cplusplus-Program2
CS-210


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
This project was a C++/Python console application simulating a grocery store product tracker. It allows users to see a list of products purchased in given day, see how many times a specified item was purchased, and view a histogram of items purchased in a day.

What did you do particularly well?
I did well in this project entirely by writing clear, concise, and well commented code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could of enhanced my code by adding more features or improving on the histogram.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did not find any pieces challenging to write, but I did have a bit of trouble having the too languages work together as I forgot to add the .dll's. I do now have it imbedded in my brain to check the files in my release folder after having continuous errors, so I have learned from my mistakes.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I already had strong python and C++ skills coming into this course. This project (and course) has helped to sharpen those skills and stregthen my knowledge of the languages.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used functions for each complex task, limiting the amount of code in main.
I used standard naming conventions for variables and functions.
I wrote clear and easy to read code that was well maintainable making my code reusable and understandable.
